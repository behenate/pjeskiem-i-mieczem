**In this very special repository, two warriors: Zuzia and Wojtek took a hard challenge to create a game (Shakes and Fidget and Swords and Sandals crossover) with doggos in the main role.**



The game was created with the raw pencil-written style and flipbook aestethic.

We are very proud soooo...
**Have a nice game**!



The game was created for "Object Oriented Programming" course on AGH UST. The instrucions for the task are located in the link below:

Instructions and the game UI are written in polish, because the course was lectured in polish.
